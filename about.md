title: About Me
---

My name is Jamal Smith, I am 20 years old, I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia in the great country of Canada.

I go to school here at Saint Mary's university, where I am currently studying towards an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.

I've always had an interest in computers and the secret magic they do. It's always boggled my mind and fascinated me at the very same time, how complex computer systems and the software that runs on top of them are, but as well how elegant they can be designed. For these reasons and more, my particular field of interest in computer science is low level systems, and programming on and with them.

Also, one of my favorite hobbies is reading, for knowledge and for fun. I do read books, I'm reading G.R.R.M's *A Dance with Dragons* right now and its *soo good*. But I do a lot of my reading online. The Internet has a whole wealth reading material, such as articles on interesting subjects or blogs by interesting people. So much so, that I could never be bored. And I'm never bored.

Thanks for reading!
